Basics:

Var assignment:

Inside a function, the := short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type.

Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.

Little confusing between := and = at first.

Flow Control

Map vs map confusion

*
We often need our programs to perform operations on collections of data, like selecting all items that satisfy a given predicate or mapping all items to a new collection with a custom function.

In some languages it’s idiomatic to use generic data structures and algorithms. Go does not support generics; in Go it’s common to provide collection functions if and when they are specifically needed for your program and data types.*


Ditch map

Use range and convert as we go, not as clean as have to do at every interation

2 for loops with in each other

Operators multipilcation * 

String interpolation just works
